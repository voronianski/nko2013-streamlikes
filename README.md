**Streamlikes** app is somekind of a radio for recent popular tracks and mixes of your favorite bands and artists.

For now it works as follows:

1. Gets your music and bands likes from Facebook
2. Shows available for streaming track suggestions via [Shuffler.fm](http://shuffler.fm/)

You can take a look and play with it **only** on your local machine!

## How to start

Clone this repo and run ``npm install`` inside it, then run ``node server.js`` and check out ``localhost:8000`` in your browser!

## Details

More details about the project and team you can find on official Node Knockout 2013 web site - http://nodeknockout.com/teams/kosmetika.

Also I wrote a short blog post promoting this application - http://pixelhunter.me/post/66874604661/vote-for-streamlikes-hack-entry-for-node-knockout and made small but funny pitch video - http://youtu.be/7gP79SxRPPc :)

If you have some questions or suggestions then please rise an [issue](https://github.com/voronianski/nko2013-streamlikes/issues) or send me an email.
